    <p id="one">This version of Connect 4 was coded by John Neill. I wrote it to keep my JavaScript skills sharp. As a former math teacher, I finally have an answer for "what's the point of all this math, Mr. Neill?" This game has some heavy trig happening! <a href="https://github.com/oldmanneill/connect4" target="_blank">Check out my source code here.</a></p>
